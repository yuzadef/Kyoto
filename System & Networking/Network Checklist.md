# Network checklist

A pentesting checklist is a tool that helps you track and plan your way in to a web and application but for this section, it is for network.

- [ ] Run Rustscan/Nmap for running ports.
- [ ] Get details from the network scan.
- [ ] Note the versions of any services.
- [ ] See if there is any public CVE's that can be used.
- [ ] Try connecting to the services. **See if you can connect without credentials**
